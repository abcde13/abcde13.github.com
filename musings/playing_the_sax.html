          <p>About two months ago, my mom took out my old saxophone from some place only mom's know about. We had talked about a sax solo that was part of a piece she was listening to, and it prompted a discussion about playing the saxophone again. The last time I touched my saxophone was freshman year of high school. My mind was flooded with memories as I gazed at the saxophone that had started my flirtation with music fifteen years ago. Fond memories, but often supplanted by the thought that I was not a good sax player. This is my own opinion and I haven't asked for anyone else's opinion on the subject. To be fair, I was in jazz and symphonic band in high school, so that must speak to a modicum of skill. Yet, compared to my fellow saxophonists, I maintain that I was the worst. I want to stroll through my memories of me and my saxophone before getting to what I'm doing in present day.</p>

          <p>In elementary school, everyone practices for a single end-of-year concert. When that time came I distinctly remember sitting in my chair at the far right end of a row, blowing my horn in a way only a child with a couple of lessons but no true understanding of quality sound could. Before our last piece, a high school band joined us. Since I was at the end of the row, one of the saxophonists from high school pulled up a chair and settled in next to me. That's when my eyes caught his magnificent beast of a red saxophone. I could not peel my eyes off the beaut, and its deepness rocked me. I learned what a baritone saxophone was that day, and I swore to myself that I would play it at some point in my life.</p>

            <p>If you can imagine thise goose honking, that's probably what I sounded like</p>
          </div>

          <p>Fast forward to the last year of middle school, symphonic band. I didn't practice as much as I should have, but it was the "easiest" of my classes because there were no tests. There came a moment when our band teacher, Mr. Lorigan, announced that he would like someone to play the baritone sax. That person would also need to play in the jazz band, even though it wasn't a required club. I had no jazz experience, but my ears perked up at the fortuitous chance to play the baritone sax. After class I entered Mr. Lorigan's office and informed him of my desire to play it. I never forgot his response: "Normally I would give the opportunity to the best saxophone player, but no one has volunteered, so sure." Now Mr. Lorigan is one of the nicest teacher's I've had. I looked forward to his class everyday, except when I was singled out to play a tune I couldn't. But his words cut, and my heart skipped a beat. I knew I wasn't the best, but I didn't realize the gap was significant enough to warrant possibly not playing the bari sax. Nevertheless, I went on to play the instrument in symphonic and jazz band, performed a couple of improvised solos during which I believe I was not in the right key, and had a great time fulfilling my childhood promise to myself.</p>

            <p>I wish I had a stand for my baritone sax like that when I played it</p>
          </div>

          <p>Finally, in the same year, there was a joint middle school performance in which we had to audition for first, second, and third positions. There was only one other bari sax player, an amiable fellow named Forrest. When it came time to audition for the piece, there were notes I had never successfully played before. I had exercised-induced asthma, and had always assumed I couldn't play those notes because of my condition. I didn't wheeze like I did when sprinting during soccer, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the way I played. I explained my issue to Mr. Lorigan, and he told me to do my best. Well, it should come as no surprise that I couldn't play those notes and took second seat. Not a great feeling, but Forrest was an excellent chap and I had fun playing with him.<p>

          <p>Present day. I've been playing the sax again for about a month or two. Since I started relearning to play, I've been asking myself questions. Why couldn't I play those notes? What should I have practiced? What specifically made other saxophonists better? How do I hit those notes? What was I supposed to do during my solo? What makes a solo a good solo?</p>

          <p>I have answers to those questions now. The notes that I couldn't play that day, I can now. I still don't know if it was my asthma or my lack of practice with breath control, but I forgive myself for not knowing. I'm practicing my quiet and long tones, my overtones, and my scales. I'm readjusting my embouchure to get a fuller sound, regardless of how tiring it is (don't worry, I break accordingly).  While writing code I occasionally force my lips into a fish position and hold it, strengthening my embouchure. I'm learning my scales backwards and forwards, in quarters, triplets, eighths, and sixteenths, and in all sorts of skipping patterns over the whole range of the horn. I'm beginning to grasp the circle of fifths and understand why knowing the key of song makes playing simpler and solos better. I can't vibrato or growl, but I'll save that for later, when my tone is strong.</p>

          <p>But perhaps the most important thing is, I've picked up the saxophone of my own volition. Not to go to class but to play tunes to my heart's content. I love attempting to play Yui's Again or Fairy Tail's main theme song. They aid me in setting and achieving goals too. Can I play this piece at 80 bpm? What about at 110?  Every practice session I know how to warmup, how to work on my fundamentals, and how to break down the piece I'm trying to master. The best part is that I know I'm making progress both in sound quality and in my understanding of music. The very knowledge that I can look at a piece and understand mentally how my fundamentals are going to apply invigorates me, however odd that may sound. What's more, I've learned a bit of Audacity to mix backing tracks into my recordings in order to upload <a href="https://youtu.be/wq6wQIyaZK0?t=11">covers to YouTube</a> and get feedback from friends and forums like on <a href="https://bettersax.com/">BetterSax</a> , which I am a member of.</p>

            <p>Can I be as cool as this guy some day?</p>
          </div>

          <p>As for the future, I hope that by springtime next year, I'll be grooving to Giorno Giovanna's theme or wistfully playing The Real Folk Blues by The Seatbelts. I've got a new saxophone, a black Selmer La Voi II, and I'm excited to invest time and get good at something I considered myself weak at my entire life.</p>
