          <p>I know what some of you were thinking as you laid your eyes upon the font of the main headings of my site. "That's a weird font. And why cursive?" It's almost as if I made the irrevocable mistake of using Comic Sans. But I like this font, and I didn't make a mistake picking it.</p>
          <p>I chose this font because I like the way my name looks in cursive. To be precise, I'm inextricably bound to the look of a correct cursive capital "J". I distinctly remember my parents teaching me how to write a capital "J" in cursive and how it relates to my name. "jor", or rather, "zor" in Punjabi means "might" or "strength". Thus, the "J" has to have a solid back. No bending allowed. That's why I chose this particular font. Other fonts had "J" written in a very fancy manner, but none true to the proper cursive "J" that I was taught.</p>

            <p>Look at that unbreakable back</p>
          </div>
          <p>Amongst my peers, I noticed I'm one of the few that writes in cursive. I'm not an aesthete and it's not my creative outlet. It's how I learned to write. It's also why I always finished last when copying vocabulary sentences in high school. Yet I wish I spent more dedicated time improving my handwriting since it tends to be illegible. I recall reading a book describing how my poor handwriting was a chance to discover my psyche. Heavy forward slant indicates strong emotional responses and curls that cross back over characters dictate a messy lifestyle. I can't recall if that's what it really said, but these days I spend very little time writing with pen and paper, so I like to think it doesn't matter. Someday I might return to conquer my handwriting. For now, I fulfill my desire for a crisp, legible cursive that may or may not have psychological underpinnings via a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yellowtail?category=Handwriting">beautiful but simple cursive font.</a></p>

            <p>Maybe I should drop cursive and just copy Obama's style <a href="#citation1">[1]</a></p>
          </div>
          <p>Finally, the font reflects what I believe is important to my site. And I don't mean that in a "freedom of expression through font" way. The site is nondescript. There are no colors, no large callouts, and no contrasting parts of the page. All the reader can focus on is the content. You might argue that this is simply minimalist design. I'd hi-five you, put my arm around your shoulder, and eagerly point out that minimalism is woven into the very foundations of the site. No modern-day web frameworks were used. It's all native HTML and CSS. I agonized over only two features: how to get the layout right with minimal code and what font to use. What emerged is a blazing fast mobile-friendly site that piques the reader's interest because of my cursive font but then lets the reader settle down and focus on what she came to do: read.</p>

          <p> Enjoy your focused reading, with a dash of cursive. </p>
