          A personal take on cursive, handwriting, fonts, and why I like how my name looks
        </div>
        <div class="article_body">

          <p>I know what some of you thought when you saw the font for the main headings of this site. "That's a weird font. And why cursive?" It's almost as if I made the irrevocable mistake of using Comic Sans. But personally, I like this font. I don't spend too much time looking at fonts, and I'm by no means an expert. I know that a sans serif font is a serif font, sans the serif, but I had to lookup what a serif is (the decorative stroke at the end of the lettering).</p>
          <p>I chose this font because I like the way my name looks in cursive. I distinctly remember may parents teaching me how to write J in cursive, and how it relates to my name. "jor", or rather, "zor" in Punjabi means "might" or "strength". Thus, the J has to have a solid back, no bending allowed. That's why I chose this particular font. Other fonts had J's written in a very fancy manner, but none true to the proper cursive J that is taught. </p>

            <p>Look at that unbreakable back</p>
          </div>
          <p> Among my peers, I seem to be one of the few that writes mostly in cursive. I'm no aesthete, it's just how I learned to write. In fact, I was always last to finish copying vocabulary sentences in highschool, probably because of that. Despite my writing slowly, my handwriting isn't all that legible, and I wish I spent more dedicated time improving it. I even recall a book I read about the pyschology of handwriting. Heavy forward slant indicates a strong emotional response to things and curls that cross back over characters dictate a messy lifestyle. I can't recall if that's true or not, but these days I spend very little time writing with pen and paper at all, so it may not matter. Instead I fulfill my desires for a crisp, legible cursive that may or may not have pyschological underpinnings via the clean font I've chosen for this page.</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/obama_psych.jpg" style="width:40%"/>
            <p>Maybe I should drop all this cursive nonsense and just copy Obama's style. I think he got something right</p>
          </div>
          <p> The font is also a reflection of what I consider is important for this site. And I don't mean that in a "freedom of expression through font" way. The site itself is nondescript: there are no colors, no large callouts, no contrasting parts of the page. You might argue that this is just minimalist design. I would agree and point out that this site isn't even built using any modern day web frameworks. It's just HTML and CSS. The two things I spent the most time on were how to get the layout right with minimal HTML and what font I wanted to use. What emerges is a blazingly fast site that piques the reader's interest because of my font selection, but then lets the reader settle down and do what they came to do; to do what I want them to do: read.</p>

          <p> Enjoy reading. </p>
