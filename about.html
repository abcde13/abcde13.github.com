					<p>Being the protagonist of your own story always means that every time you fall, you gotta get up one more time. If you don't get up, that's where your story ends. </p>

					<p>For me, inspiration, motivation, and discipline tend to come from a set of imaginary characters. Sherlock Holmes, Tony Stark, Rock Lee, Edward Elric&mdash;the list can go on and on. I am a sucker for superhero flicks and anime, but there's a reason I quote Rock Lee and no one else. Everyone's trying to get by in life. Some have found that which lights the fire in them. Some haven't. Some haven't been blessed with the time to reflect on it. Whatever it may be, everyone's trying. Whether or not you argue it's fate, fortune, friends, or force of will that molds people into what they become, there's really only one thing to do: try. I like to try, like to try hard, and like to embody that persona. I enjoy being lofty in my ambitions, realistic in my goals, and laughing my way through both. Rock Lee wasn't trying to be the best at what he does, just splendid. I'm not aiming to be the best engineer, the best coder, the best gamer, the best saxophonist, or the best writer. Just splendid. </p>
